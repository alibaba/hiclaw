# HiClaw Codebase Navigation Guide

This file helps AI Agents (and human developers) quickly understand the project structure and find relevant code.

## What is HiClaw

HiClaw is an open-source Agent Teams system that uses IM (Matrix protocol) for multi-Agent collaboration with human-in-the-loop oversight. It consists of a Manager Agent (coordinator) and Worker Agents (task executors), connected via an AI Gateway (Higress), Matrix Homeserver (Tuwunel), and HTTP File System (MinIO).

- [manager/agent/HEARTBEAT.md](manager/agent/HEARTBEAT.md) -- periodic check routine
- [manager/agent/skills/](manager/agent/skills/) -- Manager's skills (9 skill directories, each with SKILL.md and optional scripts/references/)
- [manager/agent/worker-skills/](manager/agent/worker-skills/) -- Skill definitions pushed to Workers on creation
- [worker/agent/skills/github-operations/SKILL.md](worker/agent/skills/github-operations/SKILL.md) -- Worker GitHub skill

### To modify CI/CD
- [.github/workflows/](/.github/workflows/) -- GitHub Actions workflows
- [tests/](tests/) -- integration test suite

### To modify Higress routing and initialization
- [manager/scripts/init/setup-higress.sh](manager/scripts/init/setup-higress.sh) -- route, consumer, MCP server setup
- [design/higress-console-api.yaml](design/higress-console-api.yaml) -- Higress Console API spec (OpenAPI 3.0)

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| AI Gateway | Higress (all-in-one) | LLM proxy, MCP Server hosting, consumer auth, route management |
| Matrix Server | Tuwunel (conduwuit fork) | IM communication between Agents and Human |
| Matrix Client | Element Web | Browser-based IM interface |
| File System | MinIO + mc mirror | Centralized HTTP file storage with local sync |
| Agent Framework | OpenClaw (fork) | Agent runtime with Matrix plugin, skills, heartbeat |
| Agent Framework | CoPaw (Python) | Alternative Python-based agent runtime for Workers |
| MCP CLI | mcporter | Worker calls MCP Server tools via CLI |

## Changelog Policy

Any change that affects the content of a built image — i.e. modifications under `manager/`, `worker/`, `copaw/`, or `openclaw-base/` — **must** be recorded in [`changelog/current.md`](changelog/current.md) before committing.

Format: one bullet per logical change, with a linked commit hash, e.g.:
```
- feat(manager): add task-management skill extracted from AGENTS.md ([a1b2c3d](https://github.com/higress-group/hiclaw/commit/a1b2c3d...))
- fix(manager): fix upgrade-builtins idempotency (duplicate marker insertion) ([e4f5g6h](https://github.com/higress-group/hiclaw/commit/e4f5g6h...))
```

On release, the workflow automatically renames `current.md` → `vX.Y.Z.md` and creates a fresh `current.md`.

## Key Design Patterns

1. **All communication in Matrix Rooms**: Human + Manager + Worker are all in the same Room. Human sees everything, can intervene anytime.
2. **Centralized file system**: All Agent configs and state stored in MinIO. Workers are stateless -- destroy and recreate freely.
3. **Unified credential management**: Worker uses one Consumer key-auth token for both LLM and MCP Server access. Manager controls permissions.
4. **Skills as documentation**: Each SKILL.md is a self-contained reference that tells the Agent how to use an API or tool.

## Agent-Facing Content: Writing Convention

Files under `manager/agent/` and `worker/agent/` (including `copaw/`) are **read by the Agent at runtime**, not by human developers. All content in these paths must be written from the Agent's own perspective using second-person voice ("you"):

- **AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, HEARTBEAT.md** — address the Agent directly: "You are the Manager...", "Your responsibilities include..."
- **SKILL.md** — instruct the Agent as the reader: "Use this script to...", "You can call...", "Run `mcporter --config ~/mcporter-servers.json list` to see..."
- **TOOLS.md** — describe tools available to the Agent: "You have access to...", "Use `mc cp` to push..."
- **Script `log` output and comments** — write from the system's perspective, but keep the Agent as the implied operator. Avoid third-person references like "the Manager does X" — instead say "Step 4: Updating your mcporter-servers.json..."

**Do NOT** use third-person descriptions like "Manager can call..." or "This skill provides..." in agent-facing files. The Agent is the reader — talk to it directly.

This convention applies to all files that end up in the Agent's workspace or are loaded as skills/prompts at runtime:
- `manager/agent/**` (Manager Agent config, skills, tools)
- `worker/agent/**` (Worker Agent config, skills)
- `manager/agent/copaw-worker-agent/**` (CoPaw Worker Agent config)
- `manager/agent/worker-skills/**` (skill definitions pushed to Workers on creation)

## Environment Variables

See [manager/scripts/init/start-manager-agent.sh](manager/scripts/init/start-manager-agent.sh) for the full list of `HICLAW_*` environment variables used by the Manager container.

## Verified Technical Details

All technical assumptions have been verified in POC. See [design/poc-tech-verification.md](design/poc-tech-verification.md) for detailed verification results. Key findings that affect implementation:

- Tuwunel uses `CONDUWUIT_` env prefix (not `TUWUNEL_`)
- Higress Console uses Session Cookie auth (not Basic Auth)
- MCP Server created via `PUT` (not `POST`)
- Auth plugin takes ~40s to activate after first configuration
- OpenClaw Skills auto-load from `workspace/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
