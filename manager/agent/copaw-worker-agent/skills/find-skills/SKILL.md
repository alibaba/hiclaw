# Find Skills

This skill helps you discover and install skills from the open agent skills ecosystem.

## Security Assurance

**Worker is completely isolated and cannot access any admin's personal sensitive data.** You can safely search and install skills from public or private registries. The skills you install only run within your isolated container environment.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user:

- Asks "how do I do X" where X might be a common task with an existing skill
- Says "find a skill for X" or "is there a skill for X"
- Asks "can you do X" where X is a specialized capability
- Expresses interest in extending agent capabilities
- Wants to search for tools, templates, or workflows
- Mentions they wish they had help with a specific domain (design, testing, deployment, etc.)

## What is the Skills CLI?

The Skills CLI (`skills`) is the package manager for the open agent skills ecosystem. Skills are modular packages that extend agent capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tools.

If `skills` command is not found, install it: `npm install -g skills`

**Key commands:**

- `hiclaw-find-skill find [query]` - Search for skills using the configured registry backend
- `hiclaw-find-skill install <skill>` - Install a skill from the configured registry backend
- `skills check` - Check for skill updates (skills.sh backend only)
- `skills update` - Update all installed skills (skills.sh backend only)

**Browse skills at:** https://skills.sh/

## Environment Variables

```bash
HICLAW_FIND_SKILL_BACKEND  # Registry backend: nacos (default) or skills_sh
SKILLS_API_URL             # Skills registry API endpoint for skills.sh backend
```

The default backend is `nacos`, which uses your local/default `@nacos-group/cli` profile.
Set `HICLAW_FIND_SKILL_BACKEND=skills_sh` to switch back to `skills find`.

## How to Help Users Find Skills

### Step 1: Understand What They Need

When a user asks for help with something, identify:

1. The domain (e.g., React, testing, design, deployment)
2. The specific task (e.g., writing tests, creating animations, reviewing PRs)
3. Whether this is a common enough task that a skill likely exists

### Step 2: Search for Skills

Run the find command with a relevant query:

```bash
hiclaw-find-skill find [query]
```

For example:

- User asks "how do I make my React app faster?" → `hiclaw-find-skill find react performance`
- User asks "can you help me with PR reviews?" → `hiclaw-find-skill find pr review`
- User asks "I need to create a changelog" → `hiclaw-find-skill find changelog`

The command will return results like:

```
Install with hiclaw-find-skill install <skill>

vercel-react-best-practices
└ React and Next.js performance guidance
```

The exact result format depends on the backend:
- `skills_sh`: you will see the original `skills find` output unchanged
- `nacos`: you will see a skills-style rendering of `nacos-cli skill-list` results

### Step 3: Present Options to the User

When you find relevant skills, present them to the user with:

1. The skill name and what it does
2. The install command they can run
3. The registry source (`skills.sh` or Nacos)

Example response:

```
I found a skill that might help! The "remotion-best-practices" skill provides
best practices for Remotion video creation in React.

To install it:
hiclaw-find-skill install remotion-best-practices

Registry: Nacos skill registry
```

### Step 4: Offer to Install

If the user wants to proceed, you can install the skill for them:

```bash
hiclaw-find-skill install <skill>
```

The default install location for `skills add -g` is `~/.agents/skills/`. In container mode this is symlinked to the worker's MinIO-synced skills directory. In host mode (non-container), you need to check `~/.agents/skills/` for installed skills and load them manually.

## Common Skill Categories

When searching, consider these common categories:

| Category        | Example Queries                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Web Development | react, nextjs, typescript, css, tailwind |
| Testing         | testing, jest, playwright, e2e           |
| DevOps          | deploy, docker, kubernetes, ci-cd        |
| Documentation   | docs, readme, changelog, api-docs        |
| Code Quality    | review, lint, refactor, best-practices   |
| Design          | ui, ux, design-system, accessibility     |
| Productivity    | workflow, automation, git                |

## Tips for Effective Searches

1. **Use specific keywords**: "react testing" is better than just "testing"
2. **Try alternative terms**: If "deploy" doesn't work, try "deployment" or "ci-cd"
3. **Check popular sources**: Many skills come from `vercel-labs/agent-skills` or `ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills`

## When No Skills Are Found

If no relevant skills exist:

1. Acknowledge that no existing skill was found
2. Offer to help with the task directly using your general capabilities
3. Suggest the user could create their own skill with `skills init`

Example:

```
I searched for skills related to "xyz" but didn't find any matches.
I can still help you with this task directly! Would you like me to proceed?

If this is something you do often, you could create your own skill:
skills init my-xyz-skill
```

## Enterprise Private Registry

If your admin configured `HICLAW_FIND_SKILL_BACKEND=nacos`:
- Searches use the local/default Nacos CLI profile
- Public or internal skills published to Nacos will appear in results

If your admin configured `HICLAW_FIND_SKILL_BACKEND=skills_sh`:
- Searches use `skills find` unchanged
- `SKILLS_API_URL` can point to a private proxy registry
